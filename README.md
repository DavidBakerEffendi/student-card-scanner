# Student Card Scanner

This application allows any Stellenbosch student with a card scanner issued by the university to log scanned student cards. The problem of having to take attendence through slower methods such as signing an attendance sheet is now solved by simply scanning in and out of an event!

A grossly obvious MVC project structure is used so that any novice programmer can understand how the program is structured if they wish to add any modifications (see LICENSE).

Icons used are from Icons8.

## Getting started
Connect your Mifare Secure Reader to your Windows 10 PC via the Sunix CommHub before you run the program. Run the Student Card Scanner executable and select an option from the dashboard to start scanning.

### Installing the program
Run the StudentCardScannerSetup.msi to run an installation wizard which will install the program under ```C:\Program Files\David Baker Effendi\Student Card Scanner``` with a desktop shortcut and launch the driver installer.

### Hardware Requirements
* Mifare Secure Reader Model 718-10 (With Stellenbosch University Config on the Firmware)
* Sunix CommHub.

### Software Requirements
* Windows 10 64-bit
* The driver used is the Prolific PL2303 (see "drivers"). This is installed as part of the setup wizard.
